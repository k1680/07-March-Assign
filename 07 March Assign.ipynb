How is covariance different from correlation?\\n\\n    Ans: Covariance and Correlation differ in a few important ways.\\n         Covariance measures the direction and strength of the relationship between two variables, but it is not standardized.

Correlation is always a value between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative \\n         relationship, 0 indicates no relationship, and 1 indicates a perfect positive relationship.\\n         Therefore, correlation is often a preferred measure over covariance because it is standardized and can be used to compare relationships between variables across \\n         different datasets.

       "'Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\\n\\n    Ans: Outliers are extreme values that lie far away from the rest of the values in a dataset. Outliers can have a significant impact on \\n         measures of central tendency and dispersion.\\n         For measures of central tendency, outliers can skew the results towards the direction of the outlier. For example, if there is an outlier with a very high value \\n         in a dataset, the mean will be pulled towards that high value, making it a less representative measure of the typical value in the dataset. \\n         The median, on the other hand, is less affected by outliers, as it is simply the middle value of the dataset when sorted.\\n         For measures of dispersion, outliers can greatly affect the range and standard deviation. The range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum \\n         values in the dataset, will be larger if there are outliers at the extremes. Similarly, the standard deviation, which measures the spread of the values \\n         around the mean, will be larger if there are outliers present.\\n         For example, consider a dataset of salaries for a company, with most employees making between $30,000 and $70,000, but with one executive earning $1,000,000. \\n         If we calculate the mean salary for this dataset, it will be heavily influenced by the outlier, resulting in a much higher value than what is typical for most \\n         employees.
